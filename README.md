# Experiment 3
### Program 1
### Aim:
To take two numbers from the user and perform arithmetic operations on them.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

## Theory:
Arithmetic operators in C++ let you perform basic math operations:

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus (remainder after division)
### Output:
The program will show the results of arithmetic operations on the two numbers.

### Conclusion:
We learned how to apply arithmetic operators to perform calculations in C++.

### Program 2
### Aim:
To take two numbers from the user and perform comparison operations on them.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

## Theory:
Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false):

==: Equal to
!=: Not equal to
<: Less than
>: Greater than
<=: Less than or equal to
>=: Greater than or equal to
### Output:
The program will show the results of comparing the two numbers.

### Conclusion:
We learned how to use relational operators to compare values in C++.

### Program 3
Aim:
To take two numbers from the user and perform logical operations on them.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

## Theory:
Logical operators in C++ work with boolean values and include:

&&: Logical AND (both conditions must be true)
||: Logical OR (at least one condition must be true)
!: Logical NOT (inverts the truth value)
### Output:
The program will show the results of logical operations on the two numbers.

### Conclusion:
We learned how to use logical operators to make decisions based on boolean logic in C++.
